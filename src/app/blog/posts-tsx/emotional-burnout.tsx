          We all have days when we feel tired, unmotivated, or mentally drained. That's part of life. But when those days stretch into weeks or months, you might be experiencing something deeper: emotional burnout.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Emotional burnout isn't just a bad mood or a rough patch. It's a chronic state of emotional exhaustion that can sneak up quietly and, if left unchecked, hit you like a freight train. The good news? You can learn to spot the warning signs early—before burnout takes over your mental, emotional, and even physical health.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What Is Emotional Burnout?</h2>
        <p>
          At its core, emotional burnout is a state of chronic stress that leads to feelings of detachment, hopelessness, and depletion. It often stems from long-term emotional demands—whether from work, caregiving, relationships, or personal expectations.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          It's not just for overworked professionals. Anyone can burn out: parents, students, entrepreneurs, or even people who seem to have it all together.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Early Signs You Shouldn't Ignore</h2>
        <p>
          Here's how burnout tends to show up—quietly, subtly, and often brushed off as "just being tired." But if you notice these signs lingering, it's time to check in with yourself:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">1. You Feel Constantly Drained</h3>
        <p>
          Not just tired—emotionally exhausted. You wake up tired, go through your day in a fog, and collapse at night with little memory of what you did. Even things you used to enjoy feel like chores.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Small Tasks Feel Overwhelming</h3>
        <p>
          Filing an email, cooking dinner, replying to a text—they suddenly feel like huge mountains to climb. This isn't laziness; it's your mind waving a red flag.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">3. You've Become More Cynical or Detached</h3>
        <p>
          Maybe you catch yourself snapping more often, or you feel numb when you used to feel excited, sad, or empathetic. Emotional detachment is a key sign that your system is in self-protection mode.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">4. Sleep Isn't Helping</h3>
        <p>
          You're sleeping, maybe even more than usual, but waking up just as tired. Or you're tossing and turning with racing thoughts. Burnout often disrupts natural sleep cycles.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">5. You're Getting Sick More Often</h3>
        <p>
          Burnout doesn't stay in your head. It wears down your immune system, making you more prone to headaches, stomach issues, and colds.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">6. You've Lost Interest in Things You Loved</h3>
        <p>
          That hobby, friend group, or weekend ritual you used to enjoy? Suddenly, it's hard to care. Emotional burnout can suck the joy out of life.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Why It's So Easy to Miss</h2>
        <p>
          The slow build of burnout makes it deceptive. We're often conditioned to push through, to hustle, to not complain. So when early symptoms show up, we often write them off as weakness, laziness, or "just a phase."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          But burnout doesn't go away with more coffee or a weekend off. It needs real attention and care.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What You Can Do About It</h2>
        <p>
          If you recognize yourself in the signs above, here are small but powerful steps to start recovering and protecting your emotional health:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Name it</h3>
        <p>
          Acknowledging burnout is the first step to taking back your power.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Set boundaries</h3>
        <p>
          That might mean saying no more often, limiting screen time, or carving out quiet time each day.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Talk to someone</h3>
        <p>
          A friend, therapist, or coach can help you process what you're feeling and offer perspective.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Prioritize rest</h3>
        <p>
          Not just sleep—rest your mind. Unplug, daydream, breathe.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Reintroduce joy in small ways</h3>
        <p>
          Even if it's just five minutes a day. Joy isn't a luxury—it's fuel.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mt-6">
          Remember, recognizing the signs of burnout is the first step toward recovery. If you're experiencing these symptoms, 
          don't hesitate to reach out for professional help. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.
