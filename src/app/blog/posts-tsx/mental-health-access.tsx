    content: `In today's fast-paced, high-pressure world, mental health is no longer a niche concern—it's a universal issue. 
  From anxiety and depression to trauma and burnout, psychological struggles affect people from all walks of life. 
  Yet despite growing awareness, access to mental health support remains limited and often unaffordable. 
  It's time to ask a crucial question: why isn't mental health care treated like any other essential health service?

  The answer lies in stigma, structural inequality, and economic barriers. 
  To build a healthier, more compassionate society, mental health support must be free and accessible to all—without exception.`

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Mental Health Is Health</h2>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    We often talk about "mental health" as if it's separate from "real" health. But that distinction is outdated and harmful.
                    The World Health Organization defines health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being—not merely the absence of disease. Depression can be just as debilitating as diabetes. Anxiety disorders can be as life-altering as chronic pain.
                    Yet while most countries offer free or subsidized physical health care, mental health care remains an afterthought.

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">The High Cost of Inaccessibility</h2>
                <br></br>

                <p>When mental health support isn't accessible, people suffer in silence. This has a ripple effect:</p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Economic productivity declines.</strong> Mental health conditions cost the global economy an estimated $1 trillion per year in lost productivity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Emergency systems are overwhelmed.</strong> People in crisis often end up in emergency rooms or jails—systems ill-equipped to provide proper care.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Generational trauma persists.</strong> Without intervention, children growing up around untreated mental illness are more likely to face similar struggles.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Making mental health care freely available can reduce these long-term costs while improving individual and societal well-being.
                </p>
                <br></br>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Barriers to Access Go Beyond Cost</h2>
                <br></br>

                <p>
                    Even in countries with public health care, mental health services are often limited, underfunded, or plagued by long wait times. Meanwhile, private therapy can cost $100–$300 per session—pricing out those who need it most. But cost isn’t the only barrier. Others include:
                </p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stigma:</strong> Cultural and social shame prevents many from seeking help.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Geographic inequality:</strong> Rural and low-income areas often lack professionals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Discrimination:</strong> BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and disabled individuals face additional hurdles in finding culturally competent and affirming care.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    True accessibility means addressing all of these barriers, not just providing a free hotline.
                </p>
                <br></br>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Prevention Is Better Than Crisis Response</h2>
                <br></br>

                <p>
                    Investing in accessible mental health support isn’t just humane—it’s cost-effective. Early intervention prevents conditions from worsening, reduces suicide rates, and alleviates the pressure on healthcare, education, and criminal justice systems.
                </p>
                <br></br>

                <p>
                    Imagine if every student had access to a school counselor. If every worker had mental health days. If every community had walk-in clinics for therapy like they do for physical ailments. That’s not just compassion—it’s common sense.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">The Ethical and Moral Imperative</h2>
                <br></br>

                <p>
                    Mental health care should be considered a human right. No one should suffer simply because they were born into poverty, live in a rural area, or belong to a marginalized community. A truly just society takes care of its most vulnerable—not just those who can afford help.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    By denying accessible mental health care, we’re reinforcing inequality and failing to protect basic human dignity.
